# Spotify-playlist-downloader
Download mp3 music of your spotify playlist.
Code made for personal purposes for free users of spotify to download their playlist.
Code works based on copying the list of songs on your spotify playlist and writing it to a text file.
The site used for implementing this does not work well so incase if the a particular song doesn't get downloaded the song link gets written to a secondary file which has to go through the process again.
PS:Some songs doesn't get downloaded due to the site issues.
